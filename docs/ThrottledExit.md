## ThrottledExit



Provides a throttling mechanism for staking pools. Instead of allowing
    everyone to withdraw their stake at once at the end of the pool, this forces
    the exits to go in rounds. Every round has a limit of how many tokens can be exited
    and a certain amount of time has to pass before the next round can start. When the 
    round is full, users that want to exit are put into the next round. Exit happens
    in two stages, 'initiate exit' gives the user the time when they can exit. 
    'Finalize exit' actually withdraws the users stake and rewards.
